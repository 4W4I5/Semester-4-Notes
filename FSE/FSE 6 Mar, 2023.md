### Approaches to modelling cont.
- ##### Structure Oriented Analysis
	- ###### Flow Oriented
		- ##### Data Flow Diagrams
			- Depict the system as a single bubble at level 0
				- Use multiple levels to show decreased abstraction levels
					- Higher levels means more complexity
			- Carefully note primary input and output
			- Refine by isolating candidate process and their associated data objects and data stores
			- Label all elements with meaningful names
			- Maintain Information conformity between levels
			- Refine one bubble at a time
				- Input and output should not be affected
		- #### Control Flow Diagrams
			- Talks about states 
		- #### Processing Narratives
			- Textual Form of both DFD and CFD
	- ###### Class/Object-Oriented analysis
		- ###### Class Based
