### Approaches to modelling cont.
- ##### Structure Oriented Analysis
	- ###### Flow Oriented
		- ##### Data Flow Diagrams
			- Depict the system as a single bubble at level 0
				- Use multiple levels to show decreased abstraction levels
					- Higher levels means more complexity
			- Carefully note primary input and output
			- Refine by isolating candidate process and their associated data objects and data stores
			- Label all elements with meaningful names
			- Maintain Information conformity between levels
			- Refine one bubble at a time
				- Input and output should not be affected
		- #### Control Flow Diagrams
			- State diagram of a system
			- Each state has its own box with possible processes
			- State transition is shown by an arrow
		- #### Processing Narratives
			- Textual Form of both DFD and CFD
			- Defines all data that is expected to flow between processes and the states the system will be expected to be in
	- ###### Object-Oriented analysis
		- ###### Steps in OOA
			- **Identify the objects**: Identify the objects that make up the system being modeled. This involves analyzing the requirements of the system and identifying the entities that are relevant to the problem being solved.
			- **Define the attributes**: For each object identified, define the attributes (or properties) that are relevant to that object. Attributes describe the state of an object.
			- **Define the methods**: For each object identified, define the methods (or behaviors) that are relevant to that object. Methods describe the behavior of an object.
			- **Identify the relationships**: Identify the relationships between the objects in the system. This includes identifying the associations (or connections) between objects, as well as any inheritance relationships.
			- **Create a class diagram**: Use the information gathered in steps 1-4 to create a class diagram. A class diagram is a visual representation of the classes, attributes, and relationships in the system being modeled.
		- ###### Benefits of OOA
			-   **Improved understanding of the problem**: OOA helps to ensure that the problem being solved is well understood, by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
			-   **Improved communication**: By using a common set of terms and concepts, OOA helps to improve communication between the various stakeholders involved in the software development process.
			-   **Code reuse**: By promoting inheritance and polymorphism, OOA can help to promote code reuse and reduce code duplication.
			-   **Flexibility**: OOA provides a flexible framework for modeling systems, allowing for changes to be made easily as requirements evolve.
		- ###### Class Based
			- Class Attributes
				- Found using nouns that reasonably belong to a class
				- Can be values that describe the current properties or the state of a class
				- Can also be a rejected class that was reclassified as an attribute
				- Not an attribute if more than one is associated with a class
			- Class Operations
				- Found using verbs that relate to a problem domain which was previously identified
				- Behavior of an Object
				- Four categories
					- Data manipulation to change state of Object
					- Perform a computation
					- Inquire about State of Object
					- Monitor an Object for the occurrence of a controlling event
				- Has knowledge about state of the class and nature of its associations
				- Operation action is based on current values of attributes of class
			- Class Diagrams
				- Attributes on the top (Data members)
				- Operations on the bottom (Functions)
				- Public members/methods are shown with a '+'
				- Private members/methods are shown with a '-'
			- CRC Modelling (Class-Responsibility-Collaborator)
				- Identify Classes, their responsibilities and collaborations b/w them
				- Process
					- Identify Classes
					- Define Class Responsibilities
						- Responsibilities are tasks or functions that a class is responsible for performing
					- Identify Collaborations
						- Collaborations define how classes work together to achieve their responsibilities 
					- Iterate and Refine
				- CRC Cards are used to create Class diagrams later on
