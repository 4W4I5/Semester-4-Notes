#### Fears of a programmer
- Deadline
- Cost of resources
- Cost of personal time
- Quality Product
- Any Flaws??
- Possible Wrong Track
- No fun
# Agile Model (Non-Traditional Model)
- Agile is a effective (Rapid and Adaptive) response to change
- Effective communication among all stakeholders
- Drawing customer onto the team
- Organizing the team so that it is in control of the work performed 
- Leading to a rapid, incremental delivery of software
- Agile welcomes changes in the requirements
- Very thorough testing of the product chunks
- No need for planning, just start working

#### Agile Process
- Scenarios
	- User stories, descriptions of the products' intent
- Short-lived Planning, Get work done as soon as possible, trash prototypes, more failure = more success
- Develops software iteratively with heavy emphasis on construction activities
- Due to multiple prototyping standards per component, multiple fully functional versions of the software are available in increments 
- Adapts to changes as they occur
- Banda ziada important ha process ki jagah, Focus more on practicality instead of by book
- Very important to understand the divide and conquer rule, Divide a very big problem into small chunks that can be programmed into quick functioning prototypes

`^Modify these points based on the Principles of Agile Methods Slides`
- ## eXtreme Programming Process Models
	- Best Known and Most used
	- New Versions may be built several times a day
	- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks
	- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully
	- eXtreme Programming Values:
		- Communication
		- Simplicity
		- Feedback
		- Courage
		- Respect
	- Involves a lot of testing
		- Acceptance testing
			- Customer sits down and based on how the program performs accepts the product
		- Unit testing

- ## XP MODEL (MODIFY USING SLIDES)
	- Planning
		- User Stories
			- Assess each Story and assign a cost
		- Values
		- Acceptance test criteria
		- Iteration Plan
		- Delievery
			- Commitment is made on the Delievery date
	- Design
		- Simple Design
			- KIS, Keep It Simple Principle
			- For difficult design problems, creation of spike solutions, a design protoype
		- CRC Cards (Class Responsibility Cards)
		- Spike Solutions (Stub prototypes)
		- Prototypes
	- Coding
		- Pair Programming
		- Refactoring
		- Unit Testing 
			- Testing on a modular level
		- Continuous Integration
	- Testing
		- Unit Testing
			- Modular Level, A brick in a room
		- Integration Testing
			- Inter-Modular level, Multiple Bricks connected together
		- System Testing
			- Final Room test
		- Acceptance Testing
			- Controlled setting tests, revise whatever needs to be revised
	- Final Release
		- Software Increment
		- Project Velocity Computed
