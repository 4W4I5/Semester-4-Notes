# Elaboration (Analysis Modelling)
- ### Goals
	- First Technical Representation of a system
		- Can be in diagrams or some base code
	- Easy to understand & maintain
	- Deals with problem of size by dividing the problem into smaller chunks
	- Use of graphics whenever possible
	- Differentiates b/w essential info & implementation info
	- Tracking and Evaluation of interfaces
	- Tools other than narrative text to describe software logic and policy
- ### Rules of Thumb
	- #### High level of abstraction
		- Model should focus on requirements that are visible within the problem or business domain
		- Focus on the problem by avoiding the solution
		- Delay consideration of the infrastructure and other non-functional models until design phase
			- Fully Analyze the problem delay first
	- #### Each element of the model should add to the overall understanding of software requirements
		- Provide insight to 
			- Information Domain
			- Function
			- Behavior of the system
	- #### Model should minimize coupling throughout the system
		- Functions/Classes should not be interconnected as intended until the final product
	- #### Provide values to all stakeholders
	- #### Keep as simple as possible
- ### Approaches to modelling (Elements of modelling)
	- ##### Structured analysis (Focus on the "What")
		- Overall analysis of the structure of the system
		- Data and processes that transform that data are treated separately
			- Data is modelled in terms of attributes and relationships (But no operations)
			- Processes are modelled to show
				- Input Data
				- Transformation that occurs on the data
				- Resulting Output Data
		- ##### Flow-Oriented
			- Data Structure diagrams
			- Data flow Diagrams
			- Control-Flow Diagrams
			- Processing narratives
	- ##### Object-Oriented analysis (Focus on the "How")
		- ##### Use of CRCs
		- ##### Different types of modelling
			- ##### Class based
				- Class diagram
				- CRC models
				- Analysis package
				- Collaboration Diagram
			- ##### Scenario based
				- Use case text
				- Use case diagram
				- User stories and task cards
				- Activity diagrams
				- Swim lane diagrams
			- ##### Behavioral based
				- State Diagrams
				- Sequence Diagrams

# Scenario Based Modelling
- ### Developing Use Cases
	- Define Actors
		- Actors can be people, devices, other systems or an external system that is communicating with the developing system
	- Develop Use cases, where each one answers a set of questions
		- Via a Use case Diagram/Text
		- Via a Flowchart
			- Activity Diagram
			- Swimlane Diagram
