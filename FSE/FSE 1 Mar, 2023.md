# Elaboration (Analysis Modelling)
- ### Goals
	- First Technical Representation of a system
		- Can be in diagrams or some base code
	- Easy to understand & maintain
	- Deals with problem of size by dividing the problem into smaller chunks
	- Use of graphics whenever possible
	- Differentiates b/w essential info & implementation info
	- Tracking and Evaluation of interfaces
	- Tools other than narrative text to describe software logic and policy
- ### Rules of Thumb
	- #### High level of abstraction
		- Model should focus on requirements that are visible within the problem or business domain
		- Focus on the problem by avoiding the solution
		- Delay consideration of the infrastructure and other non-functional models until design phase
			- Fully Analyze the problem delay first
	- #### Each element of the model should add to the overall understanding of software requirements
		- Provide insight to 
			- Information Domain
			- Function
			- Behavior of the system
	- #### Model should minimize coupling throughout the system
		- Functions/Classes should not be interconnected as intended until the final product
	- #### Provide values to all stakeholders
	- #### Keep as simple as possible
