# Scrum
`Update from slides`

- ### Emphasizes the use of a set of software patterns
	- One person does all and delivers it to the next person who also has the same idea
	- Sprint is also known as an iteration 
		- Whats an iteration? It is an iteration of every step of the SDLC process
		- `Started Recording @ customer acceptance testing, BACKLOG`
#### Backlog
- The list of all the requirements that are completely cleaned off using the first phase and second phase of SDLC
- Divided into sprints backlog that is a set of divided requirements grouped together i.e R1+R2+R3
- This sprint backlog is further divided into smaller sub-requirements (Backlog expanded by team)

#### Development
- Every 24hours a team meeting is called to present the system
- This lasts for 30 days
- The deliverable after these 30 days, can be sold as is because it is in essence a fully fledged product
- There is retrospective session held after 30 days

#### Scrum Roles
- Product Owner
	- Customer
	- Gives requirements
	- Develops acceptance tests
- Scrum Master
	- Team Lead, Manager
	- Does not have to be technical
	- Finds replacement workers
	- Sole purpose is to manage resources, set meetings
- The Team
	- The technical people

- Everyone else is not part of scrum

### Scrum Practices
- Scrum Planning Meeting
	- Whats equality vs equity
		- Equal Distribution is equality
		- Effort based distribution is equity
	- Observe the team, and distribute resources based on circumstance
	- Product Owner
- Sprint
	- Practical implementation of a part of the backlog
- Sprint Review Meeting 
	- Meeting conducted after a sprint
	- Review what went wrong and what went right during the sprint
	- Whatever wasn't completed into the current sprint is included into the next one
	- Timeboxed to one hour of prep time and 4 hour of meeting
	- Informality is encouraged, ppt is shit
	- Team demonstrates product increment to product owner's satisfaction
- Daily Scrum
	- Timeboxed to 15 min
	- Team and scrum master only
	- Questions asked
		- What have you accomplished since yesterday?
		- What are you working on today
		- Anything blocking you
		- 
- Retrospective meeting
	- `Fill in later`
