# Scrum

- ### Emphasizes the use of a set of software patterns
	- One person does all and delivers it to the next person who also has the same idea
	- Sprint is also known as an iteration 
		- Whats an iteration? It is an iteration of every step of the SDLC process
#### Product Backlog
- Prioritized by customer(product owner)
- Created using the analysis and specification document is made
- The list of all the requirements that are completely cleaned off using the first phase and second phase of SDLC
- Divided into sprints backlog that is a set of divided requirements grouped together i.e R1+R2+R3
- This sprint backlog is further divided into smaller sub-requirements (Backlog expanded by team)
###### Sprint Backlog
- Is a list of tasks achievable in the current sprint
- Overall responsibility of the Dev team including Scrum manager and Product Owner
- At the end of a sprint the sprint backlog is revised into a new sprint backlog
#### Points
- Every 24 hours a team meeting is called to present the system
- This lasts for 30 days
- The deliverable after these 30 days, can be sold as is because it is in essence a fully fledged product
- There is retrospective session held after 30 days

#### Scrum Roles
- Product Owner
	- Customer
	- Gives requirements
	- Develops acceptance tests
- Scrum Master
	- Team Lead, Manager
	- Does not have to be technical
	- Finds replacement workers and resources
	- Sole purpose is to manage resources, set meetings
		- Manage scrum activity and sprint activity
- The Team
	- The technical people
	- Tester, Developer, Designer, Coder, Requirement Engineer
- Everyone else is not part of scrum

### Scrum Practices
- ##### Scrum Planning Meeting
	- What's equality vs equity
		- Equal Distribution is equality
		- Effort based distribution is equity
	- Observe the team, and distribute resources based on circumstance
		- Distribute according to equity
	- Product Owner describes highest priority features to the team
	- Team holds the decision to what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint
- ##### Sprint
	- Practical implementation of a part of the backlog
- ##### Sprint Review Meeting 
	- Timeboxed to one hour of prep time and 4 hour of meeting
	- Meeting conducted after a sprint
	- Review what went wrong and what went right during the sprint
	- Whatever wasn't completed into the current sprint is included into the next one
	- Informality is encouraged, ppt is shit
	- Team demonstrates product increment to product owner's satisfaction
- ##### Daily Scrum
	- Timeboxed to 15 min
	- Team and scrum master only
	- Questions asked
		- What have you accomplished since yesterday?
		- What are you working on today?
		- Anything blocking you?
		- Are the sprint backlog estimates accurate?
- ##### Retrospective meeting
	- Timeboxed to 3 hours
	- Review last sprint
	- People included
		- Scrum master
		- Team
		- Product owner (optionally)
	- Questions asked
		- What went well
		- What could be improved
	- Performance, security or maintenance are presented to product owner who decides what problem to tackle first

##### Scrum Artifacts (Documentation)
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Burndown Chart
	- Shows remaining effort in hours plotted to dates
- Product Increment
	- Potentially Shippable
	- Delivers measurable value
		- ROI on shipping the product as is
		- Must be a product no matter how incomplete

#### Problems with scrum
- Other Agile methods produce acceptable results
- A project cannot always be divided into a chunk of chunks
- Quality Assurance is meh, everything is irregular so is quality assurance
	- "Mera masla nhi ha aglay ka masla ha"
- Embrace do what i told you to do now and forget about yesterday
- Nobody can not agree on a completed project
- Quality Control is given more importance over Quality Assurance
- Extra points
	- No way a product will be functioning by the end of the First sprint
		- It will be working but not functioning as intended at least not at the very start
	- Sprint Reviews would require product owners to be there at the start of every new Sprint
	- Agile processes are adaptive therefore not suitable for situations where there is high uncertainty in both requirements and technical degree (This point is kinda meh)
	- High chance of a failed project if team chemistry is not good enough
	- Daily meeting sounds annoying
	- Team member leaving during a project is no buneo
