Quality Assurance vs Quality Control
- Assurance is done in parallel with all SDLC lifecycle components
- Control is done in the control phase, before handover. The product is tested for flaws and errors.
	- Errors found in this phase are usually more detrimental to the project as to fix them the entire project is usually restructured and built up again. This costs more and hence why Assurance is important

Verification vs Validation
- Verification is used to check if product is upto mark while in its development
- Validation is used to check if the final product is functioning as intended by the customer

# Software Models

### Waterfall Model (Obsolete)
- Requirement Gathering 
- Software & System Design
- Implementation & Unit Design
- Operation & Maintenance

- Waterfall comes from the fact that any changes into the previous phase cannot be implemented
- Quality is impacted hard whenever it is noticed that one of the phases went kaput
	- It is required that you still continue and deliver the product
- Waterfall might be a viable choice only when you are sure that you have successfully completed the requirement gathering phase (which rarely happens)
- Overall it provides very low accommodation to changes

### Incremental Model (Traditional)
- Divides system functionality into small increments that are delivered one after the other in quick succession
- Every increment expands on the previous one until everything has been updated and implemented
	- It passes through requirement, design, coding and testing stages
- It lets stakeholders and developers see results with the first incrememnt, if anyone doesnt like anything everyone finds out a lot sooner.
- Such a style of model is great for projects that have loosely coupled parts and have complete and clear requirements

- Outline Description
- Specification
	- Initial Version
- Development
	- Intermediate Version
- Validation
	- Final Version

### Prototyping/Iterative Model
- `might pass out, fill in the blanks here later`
- Unsure requirements from customer, this is when it is used the best
- Throw out a prototype that might work, and see if itll happen
- Hard to convince the customer that the originalisnt the project you were working on
- Devs are lazy

### Spiral Model


### Agile Model (X-Programming)
