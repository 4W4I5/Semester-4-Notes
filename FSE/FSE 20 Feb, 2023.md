## Analysis Phase / Requirements Engineering
Lecture 1

- ##### Problems that required the use of requirement engineering
	- A systematic way of producing user stories into requirements
	- Converting User Stories into Programming Tasks/Story Tasks can be a feat in itself
	- We have trouble understanding the requirements of the user
		- Customer is always right
	- Disorganization: Requirements are not organized based on priority or prerequisites
		- Cutting off invalid requirements happens at this stage
	- We spend too little time verifying if the requirements are actually what the customer wanted + what's possible
	- We allow change to control us, it is imminent, It is better to say i will not accept further changes after X amount of time
	- Failure to build a solid foundation for the software
	- Software Devs argue:
		- They want to get right into the meat of coding, without establishing proper requirements
			- Things will get clear as they build the software
		- Project stakeholders will be able to understand what they need only after looking at the early iterations of the software
		- Req Engr. is a waste of time as things change all the time
		- They want to produce a working program and that all else is secondary
	- These arguments are all true, for small projects though. Long projects will fall under these reasonings
- ##### Possible Errors made by Req Engr.
	- Might be ambiguous
	- Might have left some details to interpretation
- ##### What does a Reg Engr.
	- Starts right at the moment during communication b/w the customer and the Reg Engr
	- Bridge from System Requirements into software design and construction
	- Reg Engr. examines,
		- Context of the software work
		- Specific needs that design and construction must address
		- Priorities that guide the order in which work is to be completed
		- The information, function, and behaviors' that will have a profound impact on the resultant design
- ##### Phases of Req Engr.
	- Seven Distinct Tasks
		- ###### Inception
			- Scope of the project
			- Understand the Problem being addressed
			- Identify Stakeholders
			- Reg Engg Asks Questions to:
				- understand the probelm
					- Who is behind the request for this work
					- Wjat will be the economic benefit of a successful solution
					- Is there another source for the solution you need
				- find out the people who really need the solution
					- Who will use the solution
				- find out the nature of the solution that is desired
				- find the effictiveness of prelim communication and collaboration b/w the customer and the dev
			- What does the Reg Engg. need to find out
				- Identify the stakeholder
				- Recognize multiple viewpoints
				- Work towards collaboration
				- Break the ice and initiate the communicate
		- ###### Ellicitation
		- ###### Elaboration
		-######  Negotitation
