#  SDLC (Software Dev Life Cycle)
- 7 steps

Most software houses are on untraditional approaches.

- Requirement Engineering (Requirement Engineer Role + Manager(Project Lead) + Some dude to record the meeting)
	- Elicitation (Requirement Gathering) phase 1
	- SRS Document (Software Requirement Specification) is the deliverable phase 2
	- Meeting will be in natural human language, not dev oriented
	- Req. Engineer will be the dude who coverts the customer needs into functional/core and non-functional/non-core requirements (a requirement in a way to make the software unique) in a technical way
	- Will also suggest alternate functionality if a certain need is out of bound
		- Might not have a core tester available
		- Not have a certain tech
		- Not have enough Time
		- Not have enough money
	- Also prioritises certain requirements at first depending on customer needs.
	- Lays down the foundation for the software testing
	- Essentially negotiate with the customer to get requirements in a feasible and timely manner.
- Design phase 3 role: Software analyst
	- Use of UML Diagrams. TRD, ERD, Sequence Diagrams
		- Archetechchutal level design
		- Component level design
		- Modular level design
- Code phase 4 role: programmer
	- studied in degree
- Testing phase 5
	- Testers are not the actual developers
	- A dev might be biased
- Deployment phase 6
- Maintenance phase 7
