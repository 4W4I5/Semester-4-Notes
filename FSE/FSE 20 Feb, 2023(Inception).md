## Requirements Engineering (Inception)
Lecture 1

- ##### Problems that required the use of requirement engineering (A systematic way of gathering requirements)
	- A systematic way of producing user stories into requirements
	- Converting User Stories into Programming Tasks/Story Tasks can be a feat in itself
	- We have trouble understanding the requirements of the user
		- Customer is always right
	- Disorganization: Requirements are not organized based on priority or prerequisites
		- Cutting off invalid requirements happens at this stage
	- We spend too little time verifying if the requirements are actually what the customer wanted + what's possible
	- We allow change to control us, it is imminent, It is better to say I will not accept further changes after X amount of time
	- Failure to build a solid foundation for the software
	- Software Devs argue:
		- They want to get right into the meat of coding, without establishing proper requirements
			- Things will get clear as they build the software
		- Project stakeholders will be able to understand what they need only after looking at the early iterations of the software
		- Req Engr. is a waste of time as things change all the time
		- They want to produce a working program and that all else is secondary
	- These arguments are all true, for small projects though. Long projects will fall under these reasonings
- ##### Possible Errors made by Req Engr.
	- Might be ambiguous
	- Might have left some details to interpretation
- ##### What does a Reg Engr. do
	- Starts right at the moment during communication b/w the customer and the Reg Engr
	- Bridge from System Requirements into software design and construction
	- Reg Engr. examines,
		- Context of the software work
		- Specific needs that design and construction must address
		- Priorities that guide the order in which work is to be completed
		- The information, function, and behaviors' that will have a profound impact on the resultant design
- ### Phases of Req Engr.
	- ###### Seven Distinct Tasks
		- ###### Inception
		- ###### Elicitation
		- ###### Elaboration
		- ###### Negotiation
		- ###### Specification
		- ###### Validation
		- ###### Requirements Management

- ### Inception
	- Scope of the project
	- Understand the Problem being addressed
	- Figure out the domain of the problem
	- Identify Stakeholders and study them
	- Reg Engr Asks Questions to:
		- understand the problem
		- Who is behind the request for this work
		- What will be the economic benefit of a successful solution
		- Is there another source for the solution you need
		- find out the people who really need the solution
			- Who will use the solution
			- find out the nature of the solution that is desired
			- find the effectiveness of prelim communication and collaboration b/w the customer and the dev
		- What does the Reg Engr. need to find out
			- Identify the stakeholder
			- Recognize multiple viewpoints
			- Work towards collaboration
			- Break the ice and initiate the communicate
	- Example set of questions
		- First set (Stakeholder based)
			- Who is behind the request for this
			- Who will use the solution
			- Will there be the economic benefit of a successful solution
			- Is there an existing solution already
		- Second set (Understand the problem and understand what the customer thinks is the solution)
			- How would you characterize good output that would be generated by a successful solution
			- What problem does this solution address
			- Can you show me the business environment in which the solution will be used
			- Will special performance issues or constraints affect the way the solution is approached
		- Third set (Effectiveness of the Inception phase itself)
			- Are you the right person, Are your answers official
			- Are my questions relevant to your problem
			- Am I asking too many questions
			- Can you provide additional info
			- Should I ask you anything else
