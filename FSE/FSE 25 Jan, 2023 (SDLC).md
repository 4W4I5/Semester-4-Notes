#  SDLC (Software Dev Life Cycle)
- 7 steps

Most software houses are on untraditional approaches.

- Requirement Engineering (Requirement Engineer Role + Manager(Project Lead) + Some dude to record the meeting)
	- ###### Elicitation (Requirement Gathering) phase 1
	- ###### SRS Document (Software Requirement Specification) is the deliverable phase 2
	- Meeting will be in natural human language, not dev oriented
	- Req. Engineer will be the dude who coverts the customer needs into functional/core and non-functional/non-core requirements (a requirement in a way to make the software unique) in a technical way
	- Will also suggest alternate functionality if a certain need is out of bound
		- Might not have a core tester available
		- Not have a certain tech
		- Not have enough Time
		- Not have enough money
	- Also prioritizes certain requirements at first depending on customer needs.
	- Lays down the foundation for the software testing
	- Essentially negotiate with the customer to get requirements in a feasible and timely manner.
- ###### Design phase 3 role: Software analyst
	- Use of UML Diagrams. TRD, ERD, Sequence Diagrams
		- Archetechchutal level design
		- Component level design
		- Modular level design
- ###### Code phase 4 role: programmer
	- studied in degree
- ###### Testing phase 5
	- Testers are not the actual developers
	- A dev might be biased
- ###### Deployment phase 6
- ###### Maintenance phase 7

Quality Assurance vs Quality Control
- Assurance is done in parallel with all SDLC lifecycle components
- Control is done in the control phase, before handover. The product is tested for flaws and errors.
	- Errors found in this phase are usually more detrimental to the project as to fix them the entire project is usually restructured and built up again. This costs more and hence why Assurance is important

Verification vs Validation
- Verification is used to check if product is upto mark while in its development
- Validation is used to check if the final product is functioning as intended by the customer
