#### Internet structure
- Network core
	- Interconnected Routers
	- Network of Networks
- Access Networks, Physical Media
	- Wired, Wireless links

##### A network enables:
- Simultaneous Access to data
	- Data files are shared
	- Software is also shared
- Sharing of hardware resources
	- Reduces cost per user
- Collaborative work by multiple people
- Personal Communication
- Easier Data Backup
	- Network manager maintains backups
	- Employees backup the data on a shared network storage device
