## Protocols(Layers) & Service Models

Is there any way of organizing structure of network? instead of just describing its various pieces
- We have various protocols for every layer of the TCP/IP or OSI Model
- Each layer represents a service
	- Via its own internal-layer access
	- relying on services provided by later below it

Why Layers?
- Everything is modular, a change in one layer will not affect not the layers its based off on.

# TCP/IP Model
- Application
	- Supporting Network Apps
		- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
		- SMTP (Secure Mail Transfer Protocol)
		- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
		- DNS (Domain Name Service)
		- DHCP ()
- Transport
	- Process-Process Data Transfer
		- TCP (Transfer Control Protocol)
		- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
	- Each process has its own port assigned to it for identification
	- Data generated by Application Layer is divided into segments
	- The decision to use TCP/UDP is made here
		- TCP is reliable, its a data stream
		- UDP is fast but not reliable
	- The header of the chosen protocol is appended alongside the port number
		- Port number is used to respond back to the application on the response
- Network
	- Routing of Datagrams from source to destination
		- IP
		- Routing Protocols
- Link
	- Data Transfer b/w neighboring elements
		- Ethernet
		- 802.111 Wireless
- Physical
	- Bits on wire

### Understanding TCP/IP or OSI
- Standard OSI model has 7 Layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)
- TCP/IP has 5 Layers (Application, Transport, Network, Data link, Physical)
- Start bottom up, i.e Physical is Layer 1 and Application is Layer 5
- Application layer provides services for an application to facilitate communication b/w another application
