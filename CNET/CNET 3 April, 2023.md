TCP Flow vs Congestion control

- Network assited flow control
- End to end assisted flow control
- How would a connection determine flow or congestion issues
	- Timeouts or Packet loss, or Duplicate packets
		- Packet loss is more severe as no ack is sent back
- For congestion 
	- Number of packets is reduced
- For Flow control
	- Size of packets is reduced
- Out of congestion widnow size and reciever buffer size, the loewr one is chosen
