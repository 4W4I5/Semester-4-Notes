3.  Applying design thinking in management
	1. Identify the Problem: The first step in applying design thinking in management is to identify the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed. This requires a deep understanding of the needs and motivations of the stakeholders involved.
	2. Empathize with the Stakeholders: Empathy is a key element of design thinking. In order to develop solutions that meet the needs of stakeholders, it is important to understand their perspectives and experiences.
	3. Generate Ideas: Design thinking involves generating a large number of ideas, both individually and collaboratively. This requires a willingness to explore unconventional ideas and to build on the ideas of others.
	4. Prototype and Test: Design thinking involves creating prototypes of potential solutions and testing them with stakeholders. This iterative process helps to refine the solution and ensure that it meets the needs of the stakeholders.
	5. Implement and Iterate: Once a solution has been developed and tested, it is important to implement it and continue to iterate based on feedback from stakeholders. This requires a willingness to adapt and refine the solution over time.
