### Chapter 1 History Module

1. Preindustrial Era:

- The preindustrial era was a period that spanned from ancient times to the late 1700s.
- During this period, management was limited and focused on the organization of armies, the construction of buildings and other structures, and the regulation of trade.
- In ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome, managers were responsible for overseeing the construction of buildings and monuments and the organization of large-scale projects.
- The rise of Christianity brought about the development of the monastic form of organization, which was characterized by a hierarchical structure and the establishment of rules and procedures.
- Monks were responsible for managing the affairs of monasteries and the lands they owned, which included agricultural production, trade, and the provision of social services.
- The feudal system of medieval Europe was another form of preindustrial management. In this system, lords were responsible for managing their estates and the serfs who worked on them.
- The development of guilds during the Middle Ages was another form of preindustrial management. Guilds were associations of skilled workers who regulated the practice of their craft and protected the interests of their members.
- Overall, preindustrial management was characterized by a limited scope of management practices and a focus on maintaining social order and ensuring the efficient use of resources.

2. Industrial Revolution:

- The Industrial Revolution was a period of significant change in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, marked by a shift from manual labor to machine-based manufacturing and increased use of fossil fuels.
- The development of new technologies, such as the spinning jenny and steam engine, allowed for more efficient production and increased output.
- Factories emerged as the primary site of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution, leading to a shift away from the traditional cottage industry system.
- The rise of factories also led to the emergence of a new class of industrial capitalists who owned and operated the means of production.
- The Industrial Revolution led to significant social and economic changes, including urbanization, the growth of the middle class, and increased international trade.
- Frederick Taylor's scientific management approach, developed during the Industrial Revolution, aimed to improve efficiency in the workplace by breaking down tasks into smaller components and using time and motion studies to identify the most efficient way to perform each task.
- Taylor's approach was controversial and led to criticism from labor unions and others who argued that it dehumanized workers and prioritized profit over worker welfare.
- Despite its limitations, the Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for modern capitalism and set the stage for continued technological advancements in manufacturing and other industries.
- EXTRA POINTS
	- The Industrial Revolution began in Britain and spread to other countries in Europe and North America during the 19th century.
	- The increased use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, allowed for the creation of larger and more powerful machines, which contributed to increased productivity and economic growth.
	- The growth of factories and the demand for labor led to significant changes in the structure of the workforce, including the emergence of new jobs and the separation of work and home life.
	- The Industrial Revolution also had a significant impact on the environment, leading to increased pollution and resource depletion.
	- The emergence of new forms of transportation, such as railroads and steamships, allowed for the transportation of goods over longer distances and contributed to the growth of global trade.
	- The Industrial Revolution also had significant social and political consequences, including the rise of labor unions and the emergence of socialist and communist movements.
	- Some historians argue that the Industrial Revolution marked a turning point in human history, as it transformed the way goods were produced and consumed and led to significant changes in social, economic, and political systems.

3. Early 20th Century:

	- The early 20th century saw the development of the administrative management approach, which focused on the overall management of organizations.
	- Henri Fayol is credited with developing the 14 principles of management
		1. Division of Work:
	
		- This principle states that work should be divided among individuals and groups to ensure that each person is performing tasks that are best suited to their skills and abilities.
		- The goal is to improve efficiency and productivity by allowing each worker to focus on a specific task.
	
		2. Authority:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of authority in organizations.
		- Managers must have the right to give orders, and workers must understand that they are required to obey those orders.
		- Authority should be accompanied by responsibility.
	
		3. Discipline:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of discipline in the workplace.
		- Workers must obey rules and policies, and there must be consequences for those who fail to do so.
		- Discipline helps to maintain order and improve efficiency.
	
		4. Unity of Command:
	
		- This principle states that each worker should have only one boss or supervisor.
		- Multiple supervisors can create confusion and conflict, which can harm productivity and morale.
	
		5. Unity of Direction:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of having a clear and consistent direction for the organization.
		- All employees should be working toward the same goals and objectives.
	
		6. Subordination of Individual Interests to the General Interest:
	
		- This principle states that individual interests should be subordinate to the interests of the organization as a whole.
		- The organization's goals and objectives should take precedence over the desires of individual employees.
	
		7. Remuneration:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of fair and equitable compensation for workers.
		- Compensation should be sufficient to attract and retain qualified employees, but should not be so high as to create a financial burden on the organization.
	
		8. Centralization:
	
		- This principle states that decision-making should be centralized in the hands of top-level managers.
		- This can improve efficiency and ensure that decisions are consistent with the organization's goals and objectives.
	
		9. Scalar Chain:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of a clear and formal chain of command within the organization.
		- Each employee should know who their supervisor is, and who they report to.
	
		10. Order:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of order and organization in the workplace.
		- Everything should have its place, and employees should be trained to keep their work areas clean and organized.
	
		11. Equity:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of treating all employees fairly and equitably.
		- Discrimination should be avoided, and all employees should have equal opportunities for promotion and advancement.
	
		12. Stability of Tenure of Personnel:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of stability and continuity in the workplace.
		- Employees should be given reasonable job security, and turnover should be minimized.
	
		13. Initiative:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of giving employees the freedom to take initiative and make decisions.
		- This can improve efficiency and productivity, as well as employee satisfaction.
	
		14. Esprit de Corps:
	
		- This principle emphasizes the importance of teamwork and camaraderie in the workplace.
		- Employees should feel a sense of loyalty and belonging to the organization, and should be encouraged to work together to achieve common goals.
		- Mary Parker Follett is known for her work on group dynamics and the importance of collaboration and communication in organizations.

# BIASES
- ### Types of Decision Making Bias
	- #### Overconfidence bias 
		- Decision makers tend to think they know more than they do or hold unrealistically positive views of themselves and their performance.
	- #### Immediate gratification bias 
		- Decision makers who tend to want immediate rewards and to avoid immediate costs. For these individuals, decision choices that provide	quick payoffs are more appealing than those in the future. 
	- #### Anchoring effect 
		- When decision makers fixate on initial information as a starting 	point and then, once set, fail to adequately adjust for subsequent information. First impressions, ideas, prices, and estimates carry unwarranted weight relative to information received later.
	- #### Selective perception bias 
		- Decision makers selectively organize and interpret events	based on their biased perceptions. This influences the information they pay attention to,	the problems they identify, and the alternatives they develop
	- #### Confirmation bias
		- Decision makers seek out information that reaffirms their past choices and discount information that contradicts past judgments. These people tend to accept at face value information that confirms their preconceived views and are critical and skeptical of information that challenges these views. 
	- #### Framing bias
		- Decision makers select and highlight certain aspects of a situation while excluding others. By drawing attention to specific aspects of a situation and highlighting them, while at the same time downplaying or omitting other aspects, they distort what they see and create incorrect reference points. 
	- #### Availability bias 
		- Decision makers tend to remember events that are the most recent and vivid in their memory. The result? It distorts their ability to recall events in an objective manner and results in distorted judgments and probability estimates. 
	- #### Representation bias 
		- Decision makers assess the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events or sets of events. Managers exhibiting this bias draw analogies and see identical situations where they don’t exist. 
	- #### Randomness bias
		- Decision makers try to create meaning out of random events. They do this because most decision makers have difficulty dealing with chance even though random events happen to everyone and there’s nothing that can be done to predict them. 
	- #### Sunk costs error 
		- Decision makers forget that current choices can’t correct the past. They incorrectly fixate on past expenditures of time, money, or effort in assessing choices rather than on future consequences. Instead of ignoring sunk costs, they can’t forget them. 
	- #### Self-serving bias 
		- Decision makers who are quick to take credit for their successes and to blame failure on outside factors. 
	- #### Hindsight bias
		- Decision makers tend to falsely believe that they would have accurately predicted the outcome of an event once that outcome is actually known. 
	- #### Revision bias
		- Decision makers tend to assume that when an object or idea has been changed (revised) in some way, it’s actually been improved and is better than the original, regardless of whether it truly is better

	- This is the tendency to focus on negative information or potential negative outcomes, even when there is more positive information available.    
- ##### Sunk Cost Bias: 
	- This bias occurs when people continue to invest time, money, or other resources into a project or decision, even if it's not the best choice, because they've already invested so much.    
- ##### Framing Effect: 
	- This bias occurs when people are influenced by the way information is presented or "framed," even if the information itself is the same.    
- ##### Experimenter Bias: 
	- This bias occurs when the experimenter conducting a study influences the results, either intentionally or unintentionally.    
- ##### Anchoring Bias: 
	- This is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision, even if it's not the most important or relevant information.    
- ##### Representativeness Bias: 
	- This bias occurs when people rely too much on stereotypes or generalizations, leading them to make assumptions about a situation or person that may not be accurate.    
- ##### Status Quo Bias: 
	- This is the tendency to prefer things to stay the way they are, even if a change might be better. People may resist change because they fear the unknown or are comfortable with the current situation.

# Chapter 3 Notes

1. Environmental Uncertainty: Environmental uncertainty is a key concept in understanding an organization's external environment. The level of uncertainty in an organization's environment can affect the organization's decision-making processes, strategic planning, and overall success. Environmental uncertainty is made up of two components: environmental complexity and environmental change.

Environmental complexity refers to the number and diversity of external factors that affect an organization. These factors can include stakeholders (such as customers, suppliers, and competitors), social and cultural factors, political and legal factors, and technological factors. Environmental complexity can make it difficult for organizations to predict and respond to changes in their environment, as there are many different factors to consider.

Environmental change refers to the rate at which external factors are changing. Changes in the external environment can be slow and predictable, or they can be rapid and unpredictable. Organizations that operate in environments with high levels of environmental change may need to be more agile and adaptable in order to respond to new challenges and opportunities.

2. Environmental Complexity: Environmental complexity is a function of the number and diversity of external factors that an organization must consider when making decisions. The more complex an environment is, the more difficult it can be for an organization to effectively manage its operations. For example, an organization that operates in a highly competitive industry with many different types of customers may face more complexity than an organization that operates in a less competitive industry with a more homogeneous customer base.

One way that organizations can cope with environmental complexity is through differentiation and specialization. Differentiation refers to the process of creating unique products or services that stand out in the market. Specialization refers to the process of focusing on a particular area of expertise or niche market. By differentiating or specializing, organizations can reduce the complexity of their environment by focusing on a smaller set of factors that are most important to their success.

3. Environmental Change: Environmental change is a measure of the rate at which external factors are changing. The three main types of environmental change are stable, dynamic, and punctuated equilibrium.

Stable environments are characterized by slow rates of change. Organizations that operate in stable environments may be able to make long-term plans and predictions with a high degree of accuracy.

Dynamic environments, on the other hand, are characterized by rapid and unpredictable change. Organizations that operate in dynamic environments may need to be more agile and adaptable in order to respond to new challenges and opportunities.

Punctuated equilibrium environments experience long periods of stability followed by sudden and drastic change. In these environments, organizations may need to be prepared for sudden disruptions and make rapid adjustments to their operations.

4. Environmental Scanning: Environmental scanning is the process of monitoring and interpreting external forces and trends that affect an organization. Environmental scanning can help organizations identify threats and opportunities in their environment and develop appropriate strategies to respond to them. There are a variety of techniques that organizations can use to scan their environment, including surveys, focus groups, and data analysis.

5. Environmental Forecasting: Environmental forecasting is the process of projecting future trends and events based on current and historical data. Environmental forecasting can help organizations anticipate future challenges and opportunities and develop appropriate strategies to respond to them. There are several different methods of environmental forecasting, including trend analysis, scenario planning, and computer modeling.

6. Environmental Assessment: Environmental assessment is the process of evaluating an organization's external environment to identify opportunities and threats. Environmental assessment typically involves a comprehensive analysis of the organization's internal and external environments, including factors such as market trends, customer behavior, and competition. There are several different tools and techniques that organizations can use to conduct an environmental assessment, including SWOT analysis and Porter's Five Forces model.

7. Responding to Environmental Uncertainty: Organizations can respond to environmental uncertainty in a variety of ways, depending on the level and type of uncertainty they face. Some strategies for responding to environmental uncertainty include:

	- Adapting: Organizations can adapt their operations and strategies to respond to changes in their environment. This might involve changing products or services, entering new markets, or developing new technologies.
	
	- Diversifying: Organizations can diversify their operations and product offerings to reduce their reliance on a single market or product. This can help them to spread risk and respond to changes in their environment more effectively.
	
	- Collaborating: Organizations can collaborate with other organizations, such as suppliers or competitors, to share knowledge and resources and respond to common challenges.
	
	- Monitoring: Organizations can closely monitor their environment to identify trends and anticipate changes. This can help them to proactively respond to emerging threats or opportunities.
	
	- Contingency Planning: Organizations can develop contingency plans to prepare for unexpected events or changes in their environment. This might involve identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them, or developing alternative plans for different scenarios.


Overall, managing environmental uncertainty is a critical component of organizational success. By understanding their external environment and developing effective strategies for responding to uncertainty, organizations can position themselves to succeed in the long term.
