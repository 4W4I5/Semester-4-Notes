### NAT Gateway
- Used to communicate with the private subnet
	- Via the private route table which routes packets from the NAT gateway to the public subnet
- Restricts data flow to one direction only therefore no other way of access is provided to the private subnet
- To connect a private subnet with another network's private subnet we need to use Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	- A tunnel is created therefore any traffic inside is unknown to the internet and therefore private
