### NAT Gateway
- Used to communicate with the private subnet
	- Via the private route table which routes packets from the NAT gateway to the public subnet
- Restricts data flow to one direction only therefore no other way of access is provided to the private subnet
- To connect a private subnet with another network's private subnet we need to use Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	- A tunnel is created therefore any traffic inside is unknown to the internet and therefore private
	- Tunnel Gateway is responsible for encrypting/decrypting traffic

AWS Site-To-Site VPN

	- Spawns its own Virtual Gateway to communicate with off-site private subnets
- On cloudside 
	- Setup inside VPC with a virtual gateway device pointing to the customer gateway
AWS Direct Connect (AWS-Specific)
- Only provided by AWS
	- AWS buys a connection with dedicated bandwidth bought from ISP to get a direct connection to the internet
	- Essentially a cable that AWS sells
