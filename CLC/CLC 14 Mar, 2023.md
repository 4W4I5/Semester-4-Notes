### NAT Gateway

- Used to communicate with the private subnet
	- Via the private route table which routes packets from the NAT gateway to the public subnet
- Restricts data flow to one direction only therefore no other way of access is provided to the private subnet
- To connect a private subnet with another network's private subnet we need to use Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	- A tunnel is created therefore any traffic inside is unknown to the internet and therefore private
	- Tunnel Gateway is responsible for encrypting/decrypting traffic
	-
- Private subnet can not communicate with the outside world
	- To provision for outside comms, a private routing table is used
	- This means that the Private subnet is routed to the NAT gateway which is routed to the Public route table which is then routed to the Internet Gateway
- Routing Table Entry
	- 0.0.0.0/0 | nat-gw-id

### AWS Site-To-Site VPN

- NFV version of a VPN that allows private-private subnet interactions
	- Spawns its own Virtual Gateway to communicate with off-site private subnets
- On cloudside
	- Setup inside VPC with a virtual gateway device pointing to the customer gateway
- Route using Virtual Gateway (vgw-id)
- Allows to connect the private subnet to say a data center off site using a VPN connection over the internet
- generally used as a backup connection to AWS Direct Connect

### AWS Direct Connect (AWS-Specific)

- Only provided by AWS
	- AWS buys a connection with dedicated bandwidth bought from ISP to get a direct connection to the internet
	- Essentially a cable that AWS sells
- Amazon buys infrastructure to provide direct connections. Bypasses the internet entirely
- Same as site-to-site VPN however due to infrastructure costs, its costs more than the site to site VPN
- Requires more setup time
- Used for large-scale data transfer, high-volume workloads and applications that require low latency and bandwidth
