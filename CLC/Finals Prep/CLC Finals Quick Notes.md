# Module 1: Introduction to CC
- ### Introduction To Cloud Computing
	- NIST DEF
		- Enables Ubiquitous, Convenient, On-Demand Network Access to a Shared Pool of Configurable Computing Resources that can be Rapidly Provisioned and Released with Minimal Management effort or service provider interaction
	- Multi-Tenancy
		- Use of same resources by multiple consumers that may belong to the same or different organization\
		- Private Cloud tenancy includes sharing an onsite datacenter w multiple business units i.e the organization manages the hardware and grants more individual level control to its tenants
		- Public Cloud tenancy includes sharing resources b/w multiple organizations
	- Cloud Computing Models
		- Not required for services to fit these models, as this is a reference model
		- IaaS
			- Cloud Based Services over Internet
			- Access to networking, computational and storage resources
			- 
		- PaaS
			- Tools over Internet
			- Development/Application Platforms
			- Examples
				- Databases
				- VMs
				- File Servers
		- SaaS
			- Product over Internet
	- Cloud Deployment Models
		- Public
			- Accessible by all, Off-Site, Managed by 3rd party provider and intended for the public or a large industry group
		- Private
			- Trusted access only, On-Site, Managed by organization and intended for a single organization too
			- Sought for ability to dedicate resources with more control
		- Hybrid
			- Accessible by access only and all, On/Off-site, Managed by both organization/3rd party provider.
			- Consists of two or more Private/Public Clouds bound together by tech that enables data/application portability i.e. cloud bursting (load balancing b/w clouds)
