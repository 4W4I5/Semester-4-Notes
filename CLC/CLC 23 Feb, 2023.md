### Securing a new AWS Account: Setting up CloudTrail

- Tracks User activity on your account
	- Logs all API requests to all supported services
		- What services are not supported?
- Basic CloudTrail is enabled by default and is free
	- It stores 90 days worth of activity
- It requires to be setup at first if more than 90 days are required and specified event alerting is required
	- Also needs its own S3 Bucket to store extra logs
	- Needs to be applied to all Regions
	- Only admin should have access


###### NIST CySec Framework
- 5 Phases
	- Identify
		- Assets
			- Data
		- Risks
	- Protect
		- Protect data access
		- Can be with
			- Encryption
			- Firewall Access
			- Physical Security
				- Lock Storage devices to the server
	- Detect
		- Second line of defense
		- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
		- Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM)
		- Alerting Admin
	- Respond
		- Contain detected intrusion and stop any suspected activity
		- Remove the intrusion
		- Disconnect the system (This is bad cause then you are susceptible to DOS attacks)
		- Forensics but this occurs at the end of the Respond Phase
	- Recover
		- Data Backups are restored
		- Bring system back online

### Best practices to secure an AWS account
- Secure Logins with MFA
- Delete account root user access keys
- Create individual IAM Users and grant permissions according to principle of least privilege
- Use Groups to assign perms to IAM Users
- Configure a strong password policy
- Delegate using roles instead of sharing creds
- Monitor account activity by using CloudTrail
