# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- ###### Identity Verification (Authenticated)
	- Verify that the end user is actually the person that they say they are
- ###### Access Management
	- Make sure that the verified user can only perform actions that they have the clearance for

### Usage for IAM
- IAM is a no cost feature
- IAM service configs are GLOBAL, settings are applied across all AWS Regions
- A resource is an entity in an AWS Account that you can work with, e.g. EC2 or S3 Bucket
	- IAM would manage who can terminate these instances
- IAM defines fine-grained access rights
	- WHO can access the resource
		- Usually an already authenticated user
	- WHICH resources can be accessed and what can the user do to the resource
		- Depends on the level of clearance the authenticated user has. For example, (NOTE:: this is a bad example but it suffices to explain the concept)
			- A Worker level person can only just use the vm
			- A Manager level can manage VMs(create them or delete), set up VPC Networks, Create buckets
	- HOW resources can be accessed
		- Methods of access, most examples i can think of are firewall based
		- Specify whether a certain user of specific clearance can use SSH to use the EC2 instance
		- Basically what kind of interface is provided to the user of specified clearance


### IAM Roles
- IAM User
	- Person or entity that can be authenticated with a cloud account
	- Could also be an application, e.g. service bot from google
	- Access Levels:
		-  Programmatic Access
			- Auth using
				- Access key ID
						- Secret Access Key
					- Provides AWS CLI & AWS SDK access
					- Can implement AWS Access into custom programs by the user, it is basically an API Call
				- AWS Management Console Access
					- Auth using
						- 12 Digit Account ID or alias
						- IAM Username
						- IAM Password
					- If enabled, MFA (MultiFactored Authentication) prompts for a authentication code
			- `FIX FORMATTING HERE`
- IAM Group
	- Collection of IAM User(s) that are granted local authorization
	- Can be assigned a specific rule all at once
- IAM Policy
	- A document(Artifact) that defines which resources can be accessed and the level of access to each resource
	- Allows for fine-grained access control
	- Think of it as the actual rule that is applied to the target IAM User or IAM group
	- Two Types:
		- Identity Based Policy
			- Specify which action(s)/resource(s) is and or are allowed/disallowed
			- One policy can be attached to either a user(s) or a group(s)
			- One entity can have multiple policies
			- Assume Many-To-Many relationship
			- 
		- Resource Based Policy
			- Attached to resource i.e a S3 Bucket
				- Only read/download from the bucket
			- Select an obj and define permissions for it
			- Identity is not specified in this style of policy 
			- inline only, not managed
			- Only supported by some AWS services
			- IT IS ONLY FOR A SINGLE RESOURCE. IF multiple are mentioned then it is not a resource based 
			- BUT IF MULTIPLE RESOURCES ARE MENTIONED THEN IT IS NOT RESOURCE BASED

### IAM Authorization
- Assign Permissions by IAM policy
- Permissions determine which resources and operations are allowed
	- All permissions are implicitly denied by default (deny-all)
	- If something was explicit denied, it is never allowed
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### IAM Permissions
- Is the permission Explicitly denied. IF YES then DENY
- IF NOT
	- Is the permission Explicitly allowed. IF YES then ALLOW
		- IF NOT
			- DENY (Implicitly)
