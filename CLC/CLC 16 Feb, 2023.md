# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- ###### Identity Verification (Authenticated)
	- Verify that the end user is actually the person that they say they are
- ###### Access Management
	- Make sure that the verified user can only perform actions that they have the clearance for

### Usage for IAM
- IAM is a no cost feature
- A resource is an entity in an AWS Account that you can work with, e.g. EC2 or S3 Bucket
	- IAM would manage who can terminate these instances
- IAM defines fine-grained access rights
	- WHO can access the resource
		- Usually an already authenticated user
	- WHICH resources can be accessed and what can the user do to the resource
		- Depends on the level of clearance the authenticated user has. For example, (NOTE:: this is a bad example but it suffices to explain the concept)
			- A Worker level person can only just use the vm
			- A Manager level can manage VMs(create them or delete), set up VPC Networks, Create buckets
	- HOW resources can be accessed
		- Methods of access, most examples i can think of are firewall based
		- Specify whether a certain user of specific clearance can use SSH to use the EC2 instance
		- Basically what kind of interface is provided to the user of specified clearance
			- Programmatic Access
				- Auth using
					- Access key ID
					- Secret Access Key
				- Provides AWS CLI & AWS SDK access
				- Can implement AWS Access into custom programs by the user, it is basically an API Call
			- AWS Management Console Access
				- Auth using
					- 12 Digit Account ID or alias
					- IAM Username
					- IAM Password
				- If enabled, MFA (MultiFactored Authentication) prompts for a authentication code


### IAM Roles
- IAM User
	- Person or entity that can be authenticated with a cloud account
	- Could also be an application, e.g. service bot from google
- IAM Group
	- Collection of IAM User(s) that are granted local authorization
	- Can be assigned a specific rule all at once
- IAM Policy
	- A document(Artifact) that defines which resources can be accessed and the level of access to each resource
	- Think of it as the actual rule that is applied to the target IAM User or IAM group
- IAM Role
	- `Baad mein btaien ge sir`
