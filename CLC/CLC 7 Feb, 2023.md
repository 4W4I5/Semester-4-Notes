Why would a company want to migrate to a cloud infrastructure?
- To convert CAPEX costs into OPEX, mainly due to upfront cost involvement
	- Data Center Investment based on forecast
		- CAPEX (CAPital EXpenditure)
			- Running facilities. e.g. Funds to start a business i.e. location and furnishing costs
			- Required to pay upfront & in large amounts
		- OPEX (OPerational EXpenditure)
			- `Add in later`
	- Pay only for what you consume
	- Massive Economies of Scale
		- Scaling up a business also increases the margin of profit
			- Either sell more and have a low profit margin per device
			- or sell less and have a high profit margin per device
	- Avoid Guessing Usage Capacity
		- Scale on demand to users
		- Avoid Underestimate/Overestimating server loads
			- Either way its a waste of money, use your head to figure out why if doesn't make sense
	- Increase Speed and Agility
		- Usually with traditional hardware, there is a long waiting list in between getting the hardware ready and implemented in a system
		- In the cloud, additional hardware already exists, it just needs to be activated and that usually takes a couple of minutes at best
