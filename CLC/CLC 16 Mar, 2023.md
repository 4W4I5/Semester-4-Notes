## VPC Peering

- Restrictions
	- IP spaces cannot overlap
		- Prerequired to separate IP address spaces as that would result in IP conflicts
	- Transitive peering is not allowed
		- If A & B are peered and B & C are peered. A & C are not peered
		- Requires a direct peer link to establish a peer connection
	- You can only have one peering resource between the same two VPCs
- Used in AWS to allow communication b/w two VPCs in the cloud
	- Can be used within an AWS account, b/w AWS accounts, or b/w AWS Regions
- After establishing a connection
	- Modify the routing table to target traffic to the Peering connection's IP and the destination IP will be the host IP
-  VPC can also be chained to each other to allow communication b/w
	- your own AWS account via VPC Sharing
		- they wont need to create their own VPC but can deploy their own AWS resources and will have access to your VPC
		- Isolated resources from your account
	- multiple AWS accounts
	- multiple AWS Regions
- Restrictions
	- CIDR IP spaces cannot overlap
	- Transitive peering is not allowed
	- Only one peering resource is established b/w two VPCs
- Routing Table Entry
	- IP of target VPC | pcx-id

### VPC Endpoints

- Two types
	- Interface endpoints
		- Used to connect services via Private IP
		- Powered by AWS PrivateLink
			- Use of ENIs to route traffic to and from endpoint
	- Gateway endpoints
		- Used to connect services via Public IP
		- Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB
		- Powered by VPC Gateway
			- Allow to route over a private connection
- Points
	- Allow to privately connect VPC to supported AWS Services without requiring a gateway, NAT, VPN connection or Internet gateway
	- Keeps traffic within the AWS Network
	- 
- Routing Table Entry
	- ID of AWS Resource | vpcep-id

### AWS Transit Gateway

- Bypass Sharing and Peering
- A middleman that directly Peers all connected VPCs, provides a central point of management
	- Kind of acts like a router but in software
- Do not start with a Transit Gateway at the start, Try to use AWS VPC Sharing and AWS VPC Peering
- Supports
	- VPC Attachments
	- VPN Connections
	- Direct Connect Gateway
	- Peeing Connections
	- VPC Sharing
- Allows
	- Connect VPCs across different regions & accounts, sharing resources with them
	- Routing control using a Routing Table for VPCs and on-premises networks
	- Network Segmentation, create multiple route tables and associating with different VPCs
	- Centralized Network traffic and management
