## VPC Peering 
- Restrictions
	- IP spaces cannot overlap
		- Prerequired to separate IP address spaces as that would result in IP conflicts
	- Transitive peering is not allowed
		- If A & B are peered and B & C are peered. A & C are not peered
		- Requires a direct peer link to establish a peer connection
	- You can only have one peering resource between the same two VPCs
- Used in AWS to allow communication b/w two VPCs in the cloud
	- Can be used within an AWS account, b/w AWS accounts, or b/w AWS Regions
- After establishing a connection
	- Modify the routing table to target traffic to the Peering connection's IP and the destination IP will be the host IP

### VPC Sharing

### VPC Endpoints
- Two types
	- Interface endpoints
		- Powered by AWS PrivateLink
	- Gateway endpoints
		- Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB
Definition is incomplete, complete iusing slides or recordings

### AWS Transit Gateway
- Bypass Sharing and Peering 
- A middleman that directly Peers all connected VPCs, provides a central point of management
	- Kind of acts like a router but in software
- Do not start with a Transit Gateway at the start, Try to use AWS VPC Sharing and AWS VPC Peering
