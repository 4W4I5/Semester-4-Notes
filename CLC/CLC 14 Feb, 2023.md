# AWS Security

#### AWS Shared Responsibility model

This is usually dependent on the service model used
- IAAS
	- CSP gives the vm, hardware, bare metal virtualization
	- The user is responsible for the OS, the Middleware, the application
- PAAS
	- CSP gives the vm setup with the OS and the middleware
	- The user is responsible for the application and connectivity only
- SAAS
	- CSP gives the vm setup with the OS, Middleware and the application
	- The user is responsible for the credentials for the application account only
---
- Customer (Responsible for security in the cloud)
	- Customer is responsible for properly configuring the system as needed and ensuring it is not compromised
	- Securing data stored in multiple points is the responsibility of the customer, not the CSP. The option might be available to encrypt the data server-side, but to enable that setting is the users responsibility
	- If using a custom channel for data transfer, the channel security has to be secured by the customer themselves.
	- Identity and Access Management as well
- AWS (Responsible for the security of the cloud)
	- AWS is responsible for the keeping the services it provides, running
	- The data centers should be operational 24/7, Always accessible
	- Physically secure
	- Storage decomissioning, Host OS, Access logging and Auditing
	- Intrusion Detection
	- Instance Isolation

AWS is responsible for the cloud hardware but what if we host a PPC on there. An outpost can be deployed requiring power and internet. AWS will set it up for you but AWS will be the one managing the outpost. Now the hardware is owned by the customer therefore this is an exception where the physical hardware security is now also the responsibility of the customer.
