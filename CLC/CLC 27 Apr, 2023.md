## AWS Pricing Models

`Update based on info from slides`

- On-Demand
	- Pay by the hour
	- No long term commitments
	- Comes under AWS Free tier 
	- Per-Second Billing available
- Dedicated Hosts
	- Physical server with EC2 Instance fully dedicated to your use
	- Obvs costs more
	- Good if need to extend one license to multiple VMs
	- Only customer owned VMs are run
- Dedicated Instances
	- Instances that run on a VPC on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer
	- Cant license the same way as done on a dedicated host
	- Costs more
- Reserved Instances
	- Different upfront payment types
		- Full
		- Partial
		- None
	- Discount on hourly charges for that instance
	- Term
		- 1 year
		- 3 years
	- Per-Second Billing available
- Scheduled Reserved Instances
	- Purchase a capacity reservation that is always available on a recurring schedule you specify
	- Term 
		- 1 year
- Spot Instances
	- Run as long as they are available
	- Bid is above the spot instance price
	- Interrupted by AWS within 2 min of notifying
		- Terminated
		- Stopped
		- Hibernated
	- Prices are significantly less compared to onDemand Instances
	- Best when applications are flexible in when they can run
	- Per-Second Billing available only on instances that run Linux or Ubuntu


## 4 Pillars of Cost Optimization
- Right Size
	- Provision instances to match the need
		- CPU, RAM, Storage and Network throughput
		- Appropriate instance types
	- Use AWS CloudWatch metrics
		- How idle are instances? when?
		- downsize instances
	- Best Practice is to find the right size then reserve it
	- Procedure
		- Start somewhere
		- Monitor 
		- Adapt according to usage
- Increase Elasticity
	- Stop/Hibernate EBS-backed instances
	- Autoscaling 
- Optimal Pricing Model
	- Use of On demand and Spot instances for variable workloads
	- Use of Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
	- Use of AWS Lambda (Serverless)
- Optimize storage choices
	- Resize EBS volumes
		- Reduce costs while maintaining storage performance & availablity
	- Change EBS types
		- Pick a slower option if throughput is not the requirement
	- Delete EBS snapshots that are no longer used
	- Identify the most appropriate destination for specific types of data
