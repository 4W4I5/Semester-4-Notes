		- What
		- When
		- Where
		- Why 
		- How
- ###### Use easily understandable words

		- Aforementioned | Discussed above
		- Initial | First
		- in lieu of | instead of 
		- accede | agree

		- cognizant | know
		- endeavor | try
		- remittance | pay 
		- disclose | show
		- attached herewith | attached
		- pertain to | about
		- supersede | replace
		- obtain | get
	- Define Acronyms, Abbreviations and Jargon
		- Required to define these only at the first time they are mentioned using a parenthetically
			- If a list of abbreviations is to be used, include a glossary
	- Use verbs in the active voice vs the passive voice
		- The subject must be before the verb
		- If there is no direct object then it cant be converted
		- Remove extra words like:
			- to be
				- was
				- is
				- have been
				- will be
			- by
		- Structure: Subject + Verb + Object

## 3.2 Simplifying Words, Sentences & Paragraphs for Conciseness
- ###### Conciseness saves time
	- Explains itself tbh

	- People tend to skim through large paragraphs, therefore the concise it is the better it is
- ###### Technology demands Conciseness
	- Margins and stuff, imagine yourself as the target audience reading your digital writing
		- Resumes: 55 lines with 70-80 characters per line
		- Email: use the what you see is what you get approach. Should be able to view email in a glance i.e. 20 lines of text
		- Mobile messaging: Depends on a phone but roughly 11 lines of text
		- Powerpoint: 4 to 5 lines of text
		- Twitter or instant messages: twitter is limited to 240, instant messages are limited to 160
- ###### Limit Paragraph Length
	- Break up a long sentence into smaller concise to the point sentences
	- no more than 4 to 6 lines of text or roughly 50 words
- ###### Limit Word and sentence length
	- Use meat cleaver method of revision
		- Cut sentences in halves or thirds
	- Avoid shun words
		- Words ending in
			- -ion
			- -sion
	- Avoid camouflaged words

			- have a meeting | meet
			- thanking you in advance | thank you 
			- for the purpose of discussing | discuss
			- arrive at an agreement | agree
			- at a later moment | later
	- Avoid the expletive pattern (filler words)
		- Words like (not a perfect example but look for words that add no extra meaning)
			- there is/are/was/were/will be
			- it is/was
	- Omit redundancies
		- no need to say the same thing twice in a different way
			- during the year of 2021
			- in the month of decemeber
			- needless to say (No need to say it then lol)
			- the computer will cost a sum of $1000 (Already a sum)
			- the results so fat achieved prove (result is something that is achieved)
			- our regular monthly status reports (regular anyways if its monthly)
			- we collaborated together on a project (together means the same thing as collaborate)
			- the consensus of the opinion is to (consensus implies opinion)
	- Avoid Wordy phrases
		- common sense if getting rid of shun words or expletive phrases
	- Avoid words ending in -ing (<- just like that)

## 3.3 Achieving Accuracy in Technical Communication
- Accuracy types
	- Grammatical 
		- English grammar should be on point
	- Contextual
		- The context should be correctly representing the background information required to process the evidence being presented
- Basically, proofread your work/writing
	- Let someone else read it
	- Use the gestation approach
		- Let your words marinate for a bit then read it
	- Read backwards
		- Only to catch typos
	- Read one line at a time or print it out
		- Like with a scale/ruler so you can read out typos in larger words
	- Read long words syllable by syllable
		- ^ same point
	- Use technology
		- Spellchecks
	- Check figures, scientific equations and abbreviations
	- Read it out loud
		- If it sounds wrong, it is wrong
	- Try scattershot proofing
		- Pick a random word and see if you catch the error
	- Use a dictionary
		- Make it make sense

- ###### Chronological
	- Documents details by time or by steps i.e. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3....
- ###### Importance
	- Some points are more important than others
	- Organized by higher importance over lower importance
- ###### Comparison/Contrast
	- Compare similarities and Contrast Differences
- ###### Problem/Solution
	- Offer solution to an existing problem
