#### Technical Communication

##### Unclear Communication can lead to:
- Missed Deadlines
- Damaged Equipment
- Incorrectly Filled Orders, etc
- `Add in one or two lines to these points`

## Achieving Clarity 
- ##### Provide Specific Detail
	- Avoid using vague words, e.g. recently, some, several, latest etc.
	- Vague words are perceived differently by different people
	- always SPECIFY when possible
		- If values can be provided then do it
		- Dates as well
		- Quantify all vague adjectives
- ##### Answer the reporter's questions
	- Who, What, When, Why, Where, How?
		- Try to avoid allowing the readers the chance to ask such questions at all
- ##### Use easily understandable words
	- Use language that readers can understand
	- Avoid obscure words
	- Be careful when using acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon
		- Add parenthetical definitions if its only once or twice
		- If more then add a glossary to the end of the document
	- No need to demonstrate lexical fluency. Stay to the point.
- #####  Use verbs in the active voice vs the passive voice
	- Passive is avoided because:
		- It is unclear
		- Wordy, too many extra words
		- Answers unasked questions as well by changing from passive to active
	- Example: You are required to make a list on the basis of details shared with you recently. The list will be discussed in the upcoming staff's meeting. Add a few points related to the next meeting's agenda too so that any ambiguities can be avoided
		- `The details on the list of company policies you are supposed to make have been shared with you through email. A printed document of this list will be discussed in the next staff meeting at 9. Add a few points related to the next meeting's agenda in the list as well so that anything missing can be avoided`
