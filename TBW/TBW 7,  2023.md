#### Technical Communication

##### Unclear Communication can lead to:
- Missed Deadlines
- Damaged Equipment
- Incorrectly Filled Orders, etc
- `Add in one or two lines to these points`

## Achieving Clarity 
- Provide Specific Detail
	- Avoid using vague words, e.g. recently, some, several, latest etc.
	- Vague words are perceived differently by different people
	- always SPECIFY when possible
		- If values can be provided then do it
		- Dates as well
		- Quantify all possible words
