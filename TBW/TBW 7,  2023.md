#### Technical Communication

##### Unclear Communication can lead to:
- Missed Deadlines
- Damaged Equipment
- Incorrectly Filled Orders, etc
- `Add in one or two lines to these points`

## Achieving Clarity 
- Provide Specific Detail
	- Avoid using vague words, e.g. recently, some, several, latest etc.
	- Vague words are perceived differently by different people
	- always SPECIFY when possible
		- If values can be provided then do it
		- Dates as well
		- Quantify all vague adjectives
- Answer the reporter's questions
	- Who, What, When, Why, Where, How?
		- Try to avoid allowing the readers the chance to ask such questions at all
- Use easily understandable words
	- Use language that readers can understand
	- Avoid obscure words
	- Be careful when using acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon
	- No need to demonstrate lexical fluency. Stay to the point.
